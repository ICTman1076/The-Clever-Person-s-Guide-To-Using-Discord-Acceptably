# The Clever Person's Guide To Using Discord Acceptably
These are the rules we enforce on our own server, and we believe you should
enforce them on yourself using other servers to be courteous. **ALWAYS FOLLOW THE RULES
CREATED BY THE SERVER - they have priority over this guide.**

## Vocabulary
- A **link is considered any web address that does not fail to load.** 404 pages and similar
counts in most cases as a successful load, since the 404 page could lead to the website's
homepage or search function which could direct the user to the intended page anyway.
- A **character is considered any character not used in formatting,** unless said formatting is
line spacing etc.
- A **ping** is any form of notifying a user of a certain message, using **@mentions of _any form_**.
  - Similarly, pinging is simply the verb form of this (notifying a user of a certain message
  using @mentions of *any form*.)
- A channel or server is considered **active if the channel or server receives, on average, more than
5 messages per day** except when said server or channel has less than 20 people who are members/can type
in said channel/server, in which case it should be considered active at 2 messages per day.

## Advertising
**IT IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE TO ADVERTISE IN CHANNELS NOT EXPLICITLY FOR ADVERTISING!**

### Free advertising channels
For channels that allows users to freely advertise anything, you should:

- Ensure **what you are advertising is not, or does not endorse anything, illegal** in
the home country of the majority of the members of the server, the home country of the
owner or the home country of yours. This includes scams and viruses - [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com)
is excellent for checking for viruses. More than 3 detections and we consider that a
virus, but use your discretion.
- Ensure you **do not place more than 2 links.**
- Unless the advertising channel is marked as NSFW **do not advertise anything NSFW.**
When you are, it is good practice to add [NSFW] after the link in order to warn the user.
- Ensure you **do not use more than 440 characters and 5 lines**
- Post only once per 24 hours.

### Project advertising channels
For channels allowing users to advertise projects, you should:

- Ensure **what you are advertising is not, or does not endorse anything, illegal** in
the home country of the majority of the members of the server, the home country of the
owner or the home country of yours. This includes scams and viruses - [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com)
is excellent for checking for viruses. More than 3 detections and we consider that a
virus, but use your discretion.
- Have **contributed at least 33%** of the content of the project, or have had the idea for the project in
the first place
- Ensure you **do not post more than 3 links, and that ALL the links are relevant to the project.**
- **Describe the project in relative detail,** but **do not use more than 660 characters in describing it.**
This does not include project names, links and other similar items.
- Unless the advertising channel is marked as NSFW **do not advertise anything NSFW.**
When you are, it is good practice to add [NSFW] after the link in order to warn the user.
- **Post a maximum of only once per 3 days,** in order to let others have a chance.
- Note: Discord servers are not considered a project therefore cannot be advertised in these channels.

## Partnering
When partnering 2 Discord servers:

- The servers must both explicitly agree to the partnership and its terms before any advertising is done.
- The server with the lower member count must *always* post the advert first, unless otherwise specified by the owner of the
larger server.
- The advertisement should be placed in one of 2 places, depending on certain terms (higher up terms override
lower down terms):
  - In the case of a channel dedicated to partnered servers already existing, in said partners channel
  - In the case of an announcements channel that receives more than than 1 message per 2 days, a dedicated
  partners channel must be created and the partner advertisement placed in there.
  - In the case of an announcements channel that receives 1 message per 2 days or less, a dedicated channel is
  preferred (and therefore should be made on request) but you may place it in that announcements channel, with the promise
  that the partner advertisement does not get flushed out.

Rights of the owner and advertiser (the owner of the right always has the right to surrender that right **if they want to,**
and so similarly has the right to reclaim the right.):
- The owner of the server has the right to reject a partner advertisement for any fair reason, but must give the other server a
fair chance to rewrite their advertisment.
- The owner of the server has the right to the final say as to whether the advertisement may utilise any form of pinging users.
- The advertiser has the right to expect that the owner of the server will not edit the text of the advertiser's advert.
- The advertiser has the right to expect the partnership advert will not be flushed out within 3 days.

Advertisement guidelines:
- Ensure **what you are advertising is not, or does not endorse anything, illegal** in
the home country of the majority of the members of the server, the home country of the
owner or the home country of yours. This includes scams and viruses - [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com)
is excellent for checking for viruses. More than 3 detections and we consider that a
virus, but use your discretion.
- Ensure you **do not place more than 2 links.**, of which one MUST be a discord server invite. NO MORE THAN
1 INVITE PER MESSAGE PER SERVER
- Unless the partnering channel is marked as NSFW or the server itself is nsfw **do not advertise anything NSFW.**
When you are, it is good practice to add [NSFW] after the link in order to warn the user.
- Ensure you **do not use more than 660 characters and 10 lines**
- The advert MUST follow the rules of BOTH the advertiser's and advertised server.
